# Finding-a-donor-for-Charity-ML
Udacity ND "Data Scientist" project with the usage of supervised ML

# Project Overview
In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms to accurately predict model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Eventually I've chosen the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimized this algorithm to best model the data. The goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.

# Installations
In order to run this project following python libraries are needed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

# Files
**finding_donors.ipynb** jupyter notebook with the main programm: load, explore and model the data

**visuals.py** python file with predifined plots

**census.csv** source dataset
